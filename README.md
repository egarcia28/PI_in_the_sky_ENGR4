## Planning
### Project Outline
We will create a monocopter (samsara-inspired flying machine) that will liftoff, hover for a few seconds, and then float back to the ground, all while collecting data on the and acceleration. If we have time, we will add a remote control, then try to add directional control.

### Materials
* PICO
* Accelerometer
* 420w brushless motor
* 50A speed controller
* 3d printed components
* Button
* Jumper wires
* Bolts, nuts, and washers
* Aviation Tape
* 9mm Wooden Dowel
* A safe emotional and mental work enviornment
* A collection of cymbals and singing bowls in order to assist in the allignment of chakras

### Function


### What we need to learn
We will need to learn and understand lots of the physics surrounding the balance and lift of the monocopter. For example, on most systems, the center of rotation is the same as the center of mass, but with a monocopter it is displaced slightly leading to more unstable flight if launched from the center of mass rather than rotation.

### How will we know we are succcesful?
We will know we are succesful when we build and code a fully functioning monocopter that is passively stable, collects both altitude and acecleration data, and returns to the ground safely.

### Saftey concerns/Risk Mitigation
#### Concerns
* Uncontrolled flight leading to human + flying machine disagreement
* Fast motor + sharp propeller + human fingers = BAD NEWS BEARS
* Energetic imbalance during project development affecting team well-being
* Overexertion and stress leading to reduced focus and creativity

#### Mitigations
* Motor will not start until saftey switch has been flipped off, and 10 seconds after launch button has been pressed
* Saftey glasses worn AT ALL TIMES while launching
* significant human buffer given to monocopter prior and during launch (20-30 ish ft?)
* Integrate mindfulness practices into weekly team meetings to address and balance energy levels.
* Encourage regular breaks and provide resources for stress management.
* Foster a supportive team environment to share and address individual concerns, promoting overall well-being.
* Periodic group meditation sessions to enhance focus and maintain a harmonious work atmosphere.

# IMPORTANT - THE 7 MONOCOPTER CHAKRAS ARE...
1 - Rotor Root Chakra (Spinadhar):
Location: At the base of the monocopter, where the rotor connects.
Purpose: Grounding and stability, providing a stable foundation for liftoff.

2 - Blade Balance Chakra (LevitaBlade):
Location: Positioned along the length of the rotor blades.
Purpose: Maintaining equilibrium and balance during flight.

3 - Skyward Spiral Chakra (Ascendana):
Location: Hovering above the monocopter's cockpit.
Purpose: Facilitating upward movement and navigation through the skies.

4 - Gyroscopic Gyra Chakra (Spinathought):
Location: Centered within the gyroscopic system.
Purpose: Enhancing agility and responsiveness to pilot's thoughts and commands.

5 - Rotor Resonance Chakra (VibraWing):
Location: Dispersed vibrations throughout the monocopter's frame.
Purpose: Harmonizing the vibrations for smooth and efficient flight.

6 - Avian Awareness Chakra (BirdSight):
Location: Near the visual sensors or cameras on the monocopter.
Purpose: Enhancing situational awareness and vision for safe flying.

7 - Propulsion Powerhouse Chakra (TurboThrusta):
Location: Engine and propulsion system.
Purpose: Channeling and amplifying energy for powerful forward movement.

## Failed launches and other issues
#### 1st Launch
![1st Launch](https://github.com/egarcia28/PI_in_the_sky_ENGR4/blob/main/images/1st%20Launch.mov)
* A video of our 1st launch attempt
For our first 2 launches we opted to use a pole to launch off of. Our idea was that the monocopter would be free to spin about its center of rotation/COM which would be impaled by the pole, the monocopter would then produce upwards thrust and move up off the pole. Obviously this came with some challenges evident in the first 2 launch videos. The pole created immense forces on the monocopter that essentially tore it apart, in this video you can see the electronics compartment break and fly off.

#### 2nd Launch
![2nd Launch](https://github.com/egarcia28/PI_in_the_sky_ENGR4/blob/main/images/Video1%20(1).mov)
* A video of our 2nd launch attempt
We again opted to use a pole for our second launch, making changes to the support for the electronics cabin and other small changes to the wing's design (a groove for the motor's wires rather than a hole through the wing, flipping the electronics cabin and removing honycombing, etc.). This launch also suffured due to our metheod of launching, the pole again created huge force on the wing leading to the motor flying off a solid 30ft! More importantly, after this launch we decided that the pole was actually keeping us on the ground.

#### 3rd Launch
![3rd Launch]()
* A video of our 3rd launch attempt
For our 3rd launch we decided to transition to another design for launching. We created a pair of skids to add to the wing so it could freely rotate on the ground allowing the monocopter to find its own center of rotation. We also decided to launch in the basketball court for a smooth floor and protective fences, we also used a large cardboard box to reduce friction even more. The skids worked decently well on the box but we ran into some trouble with it, after the monocopter left the box it skipped off the ground and failed. Luckily due to this new launching method we faced much less damage after the failed launch, the only damage was to the prop which only unsrewed itself from the motor.

#### 4th/5th Launch
![4th Launch](https://github.com/egarcia28/PI_in_the_sky_ENGR4/blob/main/images/Video2%20(1).mov)
* A video of our 4th launch attempt

  
![5th Launch](https://github.com/egarcia28/PI_in_the_sky_ENGR4/blob/main/images/Video3%20(1).mov)
* A video of our 5th launch attempt
  
We kept with the pole-less launch technique in the basketball court for the 4th and 5th launches, however, we decided against using the cardboard box base due to the skipping it caused in our 3rd launch. Generally the launches went well and the monocopter even left the ground (albeit while upside down). The primary issue with these launches was the design of the skids, they had too much friction and caused the monocopter to skip, eventually flipping over. The non pole launching method ended up being significantly better, even allowing us to test 2 times in one day due to the lack of intense force created by the pole.
