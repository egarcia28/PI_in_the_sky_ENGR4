## Planning
### Project Outline
We will create a monocopter (samsara-inspired flying machine) that will liftoff, hover for a few seconds, and then float back to the ground, all while collecting data on the altitude and acceleration. If we have time, we will add a remote control, then try to add directional control.

### Materials
* PICO
* Altimeter
* Accelerometer
* 420w brushless motor
* 50A speed controller
* 3d printed components
* Acrylic laser cut components
* Button
* Jumper wires
* Bolts, nuts, and washers

### Function


### What we need to learn
We will need to learn and understand lots of the physics surrounding the balance and lift of the monocopter. For example, on most systems, the center of rotation is the same as the center of mass, but with a monocopter it is displaced slightly leading to more unstable flight if launched from the center of mass rather than rotation.

### How will we know we are succcesful?
We will know we are succesful when we build and code a fully functioning monocopter that is passively stable, collects both altitude and acecleration data, and returns to the ground safely.

### Saftey concerns/Risk Mitigation
#### Concerns
* Uncontrolled flight leading to human + flying machine disagreement
* Fast motor + sharp propeller + human fingers = BAD NEWS BEARS

#### Mitigations
* Motor will not start until saftey switch has been flipped off, and 10 seconds after launch button has been pressed
* Saftey glasses worn AT ALL TIMES while launching
* significant human buffer given to monocopter prior and during launch (20-30 ish ft?)
