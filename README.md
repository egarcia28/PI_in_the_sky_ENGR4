## Planning
### Project Outline
We will create a monocopter (maple seed inspired flying machine) that will liftoff, hover for a few seconds, and then float back to the ground, all while collecting data on the altitude and acceleration.

### Materials

-Altimeter
-Accelerometer
-420w brushless motor
-50A speed controller
-3d printed components
-Acrylic laser cut components
